So what we want to do is turn this into a highly detailed plan for creating the web app for 3D printed speaker crossover plates. The project is detailed here. We'll be using Claude Code for coding the project, and for that we need a detailed plan that Claude Code can use to execute on.  Use best practices. 
We will likely need some information on the components as we have described here in the initial plan. You have access to a MCP server called Firecrawl, and you can use that to scrape information that we can use in the application. To clarify, the application itself will not use Firecrawl. It is your task to also create the information that the application will use. 

Here is the details about the web application that we want to create from my previous research: 
Designing a Web App for 3D-Printed Speaker Crossover Plates
Introduction and Goals
Building high-quality audio crossovers often involves expensive components, and it’s desirable to mount them neatly on a dedicated board or plate. The goal is to create a web application that lets users design a 3D-printable crossover mounting plate customized to their chosen components. Such a plate would have shallow recesses (indentations) to hold capacitors, inductors, and resistors, plus holes for the component leads to pass through for wiring on the backside. This approach yields a clean, professional assembly and makes building the crossover easier by fixing each part in the proper place. Commercial kit makers have started providing 3D-printed crossover boards for exactly this reason – for example, CSS Audio’s SmartNode boards predetermine component positions and use labeled through-holes so that builders don’t even need to read a schematic ￼. The application we envision will empower DIY speaker builders to generate similar custom boards for any crossover design.
Example of a 3D-printed crossover mounting board (CSS Audio “SmartNode” board) with labeled recesses for each component and through-holes for wiring. This illustrates the kind of plate our application would generate.
Key Features of the Crossover Plate
To achieve the goals, the crossover plate design needs several key features:
	•	Component Recesses: Shallow cut-outs shaped to fit the bottom of each component (capacitors, inductors, resistors). For cylindrical parts (e.g. film capacitors or wirewound resistors), this could be a curved cradle a few millimeters deep, matching the part’s diameter, so the component nestles securely in the plate. For round inductors (coil forms), a circular or ring-shaped recess can hold the coil in place. These recesses improve the look and stability of the build by seating components slightly into the plate’s surface.
	•	Lead Holes: Each component’s lead wires will go through the plate to the underside, where the wiring connections are made. The plate should have drilled holes (or slots) at the correct positions for the leads of each component. For example, an axial capacitor has one lead at each end, so two holes spaced by the capacitor’s length need to be provided. Having the leads pass through and be soldered or connected beneath the board keeps the top clean. DIY enthusiasts have noted that adding such through-holes for wiring leads results in a cleaner, more professional look ￼.
	•	Labels or Markings: The plate can be embossed or engraved with labels to identify each component or node. This might include the component values (e.g. “6.8 μF”, “1.5 mH”, “8Ω”) next to the recesses, and/or a lettering system for the connection points. The CSS boards, for instance, use letters on the underside by each hole to indicate which wires/joints connect together, simplifying the wiring process ￼. Incorporating such labels into the 3D print can guide the user during assembly.
	•	Mounting Provisions: Optionally, the plate might include mounting holes or standoffs so it can be secured inside the speaker cabinet (e.g. screw holes in the corners), and possibly support structures to elevate it if needed. Early DIY 3D-printed crossover trays could be improved by adding small feet or spacers for mounting ￼, so our design could integrate those as needed.
	•	Adequate Thickness and Strength: The base plate should be thick and sturdy enough (e.g. ~5–6 mm) not to flex under the weight of large inductors. Recess depth might be around 2–3 mm (just enough to cradle parts without requiring too much print material). We also need to consider material – a heat-resistant filament like ABS or PETG is preferable, since power resistors can get hot. (One DIYer who printed a crossover in ABS noted it would take an extreme 10 A through a resistor to reach ABS’s 230 °C melting point, so typical use is safe, but care is needed during soldering to avoid melting the plastic ￼.)
Overall, these features will result in a plate that simplifies assembly and looks professional. As the CSS SmartNode description notes, providing predetermined component spots and a clear labeling system makes the build “fast and easy” and yields a professional-looking result ￼ – exactly what we want our users to achieve with minimal hassle.
Sourcing Component Dimensions and Specifications
Accurate component dimensions are critical for designing the recesses and hole placements. Our application will start with a limited library of popular crossover components (just enough to test and demonstrate the concept), and we will input their physical dimensions into our database. The initial list might include, for example:
	•	Jantzen Audio Alumen Z-Cap (film capacitor, axial leads) – cylindrical shape. Example: a 3.9 μF Alumen Z-Cap has a body diameter of 20 mm and length of 95 mm ￼, with ~1 mm diameter lead wires. Our plate would create a cradle for this 20 mm cylinder and drill two holes ~1.5–2 mm diameter at each end of the recess (spaced ~95 mm apart) to accommodate the leads.
	•	AUDYN Cap Plus (film capacitor, similar axial form factor) – dimensions vary by value, but also generally a cylinder of known size. We would gather those from datasheets or seller info.
	•	Jantzen Air Core Inductor (round coil) – often specified by outer diameter and height. For instance, an air core inductor might be 50 mm in diameter and 20 mm tall (depending on inductance and wire gauge). We can model it as a flat coil shape; the plate might just have a circular recess of a few millimeters depth matching the diameter to seat the coil. Two wire holes would be placed on opposite sides of that circle where the coil’s leads exit. If the coil is to be zip-tied instead of recessed, we could also include small slots for a zip tie strap.
	•	Intertechnik “Luftspule” Inductor (another air-core coil brand) – similar treatment as Jantzen’s inductors. We’d ensure dimensions are obtained for each value used.
	•	Mundorf MResist Supreme resistor (20 W audiophile resistor, axial leads) – a cylindrical body ~11–14 mm diameter and ~51 mm length for a 20 W part ￼. Leads ~1 mm. Our recess for this would be like for a capacitor (a short cylindrical cradle). Hole spacing ~51 mm.
	•	Intertechnik MOX resistor (metal oxide resistor, typically 10 W or 5 W) – usually a smaller axial component (often a rectangular ceramic body or small cylinder). We’d input the length (e.g. ~25–30 mm) and diameter (~9 mm) for these so the holes and recess can be scaled appropriately.
For each component, we will use manufacturers’ datasheets or reputable retailer specs to get the exact dimensions. Many retailers list the size in the product description. For example, Parts Express shows “Dimensions: 17 mm x 44 mm” for a 2.7 μF Jantzen Alumen Z-Cap ￼, and HiFiCollective provides detailed metrics like “Body dimensions: 20 mm (diameter) x 95 mm (length); Leadout dimensions: 1.1 mm x 45 mm” for the 3.9 μF Alumen Z-Cap ￼. Similarly, Mundorf’s spec sheet lists their resistor sizes (e.g. Ø14 × 51 mm for 1 Ω/20 W) ￼. These data points can be scraped or compiled into our component library.
Approach to gathering data: Initially, we might hard-code a small set of parts with their dimensions to get the application working. As we scale up, we can semi-automate data collection:
	•	Manual entry from datasheets: Manufacturers like Mundorf, Jantzen, Intertechnik often publish tables of dimensions for each model and value. We can reference these PDFs or websites and input the numbers.
	•	Web scraping of retailer sites: Retailers such as Parts Express, SoundImports, Madisound, HiFiCollective, etc., list dimensions for components they sell. We could write a script to scrape these pages for key specs. For example, scraping Part Express’s capacitor listings could yield diameter and length for each capacitance value. We must be cautious to target reliable sources and update if product lines change.
	•	Community contributions: Because this will be a DIY-focused tool, we could allow users to contribute new part data (with verification). Eventually the library could grow to encompass most common crossover components.
By ensuring we have accurate dimensions, the application can precisely render the cutouts and hole positions so that the real components will fit perfectly into the printed plate.
Application Architecture (Node/React Web Application)
We plan to build the application as a modern web app, with a React front-end for interactivity and a Node.js (or Next.js) back-end for any server-side needs (though we can aim for mostly front-end operation). The user interface will be crucial for ease of use. Here’s how the app will function from the user’s perspective:
	1.	Component Selection: The user begins by selecting the components in their crossover. The app will provide a menu or toolbox of parts (from the library mentioned above). They might search or filter by part type (capacitor, inductor, resistor) and choose the specific model/value they are using (for instance, “Jantzen Alumen Z-Cap 6.8 μF”). Each part in the toolbox will carry the necessary dimensional data.
	2.	Board Setup: The app generates a blank plate (perhaps a simple rectangle) on a canvas. The user can specify the base plate dimensions or let the app auto-size the board based on the components placed. For example, initially the board could be an arbitrary size that the user can adjust, or it could grow dynamically to fit all components with some margin.
	3.	Drag-and-Drop Placement: The user can then drag the selected components onto the board layout area. This would work much like placing symbols on a circuit board layout or a graphical schematic. A 2D top-down view will likely be easiest for precise arrangement. The component will be represented by a shape outline corresponding to its footprint: e.g. a circle for a capacitor (with maybe a line indicating its orientation axis), a ring for a coil, a small rectangle or cylinder for a resistor. The user can move each piece around, rotate it (for axial parts, to set the orientation of leads), and position it to their liking. They should also be able to zoom/pan the view and perhaps align parts to a grid or to each other for neatness.
	4.	Visual Guidance: As components are placed, the app might display guide markers for the lead holes positions. For instance, when you drop an axial capacitor, two small dots could indicate where its lead holes will be, so the user can see if those holes are too close to another component and adjust accordingly. We could also allow the user to click a part and edit properties (e.g. if they intend to stand a capacitor upright instead of lay flat, they could toggle the orientation and the footprint would change).
	5.	Labels and Text: The app can optionally let the user add text labels on the board. However, many labels can be auto-generated. For example, the part’s value or an identifier could appear next to it. Node labels (letters A, B, C... for connection points) could be automatically assigned once the user indicates which leads connect together (this might be an advanced feature – possibly the user could draw a line or assign a node ID to each hole to denote connectivity). Initially, we might skip complex node logic and simply focus on physical layout; labels can just be the component values for now.
	6.	3D Preview (Optional): As the user arranges parts, we can provide a 3D preview of the plate being generated. This can be done by leveraging a JavaScript 3D library or a CAD engine in the browser. It would show a rendered plate with all recesses and holes, which updates as parts move. This gives the user confidence that everything fits. The preview could be simplified (maybe just extruded outlines) or full detail. If real-time 3D preview is too slow, we might instead offer a “Preview 3D” button that generates the model on demand.
	7.	Generate STL: Once the layout is satisfactory, the user clicks “Generate STL” (or “Download Plate”). The application then produces the final 3D model of the plate with all cutouts. The result is offered as an STL file (or possibly other 3D formats) for download so the user can 3D print it.
Throughout this process, usability is a priority. The interface should be as intuitive as drawing a simple circuit diagram. In fact, we take inspiration from tools like DIY Layout Creator (DIYLC), which provides an “intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for placing components, arranging connections, and visualizing circuit designs” ￼. Our application is similar in spirit, except it outputs a 3D-printable object instead of just a 2D diagram. Keeping the UI logical and straightforward will make it accessible even to hobbyists who are not CAD experts.
Notably, we considered two approaches for design input: a schematic-driven approach versus a manual placement approach. A schematic-driven approach would have the user input the circuit diagram (which components connect to which) and then attempt to automatically place the parts on a board. However, auto-layout for arbitrary components is a complex problem (akin to PCB autorouting and placement, but here with large 3D parts). This likely would not yield optimal or user-preferred layouts without substantial algorithmic work. Instead, we favor the interactive placement approach (dragging “markup parts” onto a virtual board) as it gives the user full control over positioning. The consensus from early brainstorming is that most users would prefer to visually place parts themselves and then have the app generate the plate, rather than rely on an abstract schematic-to-3D automation. This way, the user can mimic the actual physical layout they have in mind. Our UI will thus treat the design like a small canvas where the crossover is physically assembled in virtual form, and then the software turns that into a 3D model.
Parametric Generation of the 3D Model (OpenSCAD / OpenJSCAD)
To create the downloadable 3D model (STL), we will employ a parametric CAD generation approach. The idea is to programmatically construct the plate geometry based on the parts and positions from the UI. We have a couple of options here:
	•	Use OpenSCAD (a script-based CAD tool) to define the plate and cutouts, and either run OpenSCAD on the server or use a web assembly version.
	•	Use OpenJSCAD (JSCAD), which is essentially the JavaScript adaptation of OpenSCAD, enabling CAD model generation directly in the browser with JavaScript code (no server needed).
	•	Use a CAD library in another language, e.g. Python with CadQuery or FreeCAD’s API, running on the server to generate the STL.
We are inclined to use the OpenSCAD/OpenJSCAD route, because it’s well-suited for this kind of parametric geometry and can integrate nicely with a web front-end. OpenSCAD is a declarative modeling language where we can easily represent the plate as a combination of primitives (cubes, cylinders) and boolean operations (difference for cutting holes, etc.). In fact, the developer community has already created tools to bridge OpenSCAD-like modeling with React apps. One such project is openjscad-react, a React component that wraps the OpenJSCAD engine, allowing developers to “drop in an OpenJSCAD script and start exporting STLs from a simple web application that doesn’t require any backend machinery” ￼. By leveraging this, we can have the heavy lifting done in the browser: as soon as the user hits “generate”, our app can compile the OpenSCAD (or JSCAD) script into the STL on the client side. This avoids needing a server farm to do CAD processing and makes the app more scalable and responsive.
Why OpenSCAD / JSCAD? Using a script-based CAD is advantageous because:
	•	It’s parametric: we can define functions or modules for each component type’s footprint. For example, a function capacitor_plate_cut(length, diameter, lead_spacing) can subtract the appropriate half-cylinder recess and two holes from the base plate. By calling that for each placed part (with the parameters from our library), we assemble the full model.
	•	It’s relatively straightforward to generate textually. Our React app can dynamically write the OpenSCAD code as a string based on the user’s design (or fill in parameter values in a template script).
	•	There is good support for outputting STL. OpenSCAD natively outputs STL files. OpenJSCAD (the JS variant) can output STL in browser memory and then trigger a download.
	•	No complex CAD UI is needed from scratch – we rely on the proven geometry kernel of OpenSCAD.
Implementation detail: We’ll likely incorporate the OpenJSCAD viewer for preview. The openjscad-react toolkit was created to simplify exactly this kind of scenario, as the author noted that integrating OpenJSCAD directly with React was “complicated, time-consuming, and error-prone” and the toolkit “aims to eliminate that friction” ￼. Using this, we can focus on writing our parametric model script.
Here’s how the model generation would work in simplified form:
	1.	When the user finalizes the layout, the positions and types of all components are collected (e.g., an array of objects: {type: "capacitor", x: 50, y: 30, orientation: 0°, model: "Jantzen 6.8uF"} etc.).
	2.	The app then either populates parameters in a predefined OpenSCAD script or constructs a script on the fly. For example, we might have a base like:
plate_thickness = 5;
plate_size = [width, depth];  // determined by component extents
plate = cube([plate_size[0], plate_size[1], plate_thickness]);
// subtract component recesses and holes:
...
For each component, we’d add something like (in pseudo-code):
// Capacitor recess
translate([x, y, plate_thickness/2])  // position the cutting shape
  rotate([0, 90, orientation]) 
    cylinder(d = diameter, h = , $fn=64);
This would subtract a horizontal cylinder (rotated 90° about X-axis) out of the plate to form a curved groove. The  we use for the cylinder’s length and positioning would be a small value (e.g. 3 mm) to only cut a shallow groove into the plate’s top. Additionally, we’d subtract two vertical cylinders for lead holes:
translate([x_lead1, y_lead1, 0])
    cylinder(d=hole_diameter, h=plate_thickness*1.2);  // through hole
translate([x_lead2, y_lead2, 0])
    cylinder(d=hole_diameter, h=plate_thickness*1.2);
Similar blocks (or function calls) would be added for inductors (probably just a vertical cylindrical pocket or ring shape cut) and resistors (like capacitors). The orientation parameter lets us align axial parts correctly (e.g. a capacitor rotated 45° on the board would have its lead hole positions and recess rotated accordingly in the script). We will also include text labels using OpenSCAD’s text() function, extruded by ~0.5 mm either up or down. For example,
translate([x, y, plate_thickness + 0.2]) linear_extrude(height=0.8) text("6.8uF", size=4);
would emboss “6.8uF” on the top surface at that location. (In practice, we might need to use a Hershey font or stick font for better 3D printing at small size.)
	3.	All these subtractive and additive operations will be combined. In OpenSCAD, we’d do difference() of the base plate minus all the recesses and holes. The end result is a single solid representing the plate.
	4.	The OpenJSCAD engine then renders this model. We can show a preview to the user right in the browser. When ready, the user can click “Export STL” and the script will produce the STL file bytes for download. This is precisely what OpenJSCAD’s browser tools enable – essentially bringing the OpenSCAD capability client-side ￼.
By using this parametric script method, any change in component positions or types simply regenerates a new model. It’s very flexible. We avoid the need for a heavy CAD API (like trying to script Fusion 360 or SolidWorks, which would be far more complex and not web-friendly). OpenSCAD is also something that the AI and developer community have many examples of, so building the script has a wealth of prior art to draw on (e.g. many customizers and parametric designs on Thingiverse use OpenSCAD).
One technical consideration: if the user’s browser is generating the STL, performance needs to be watched. The geometry here is relatively simple (a flat board with some holes), so even multiple components shouldn’t overwhelm a modern browser. OpenJSCAD can typically handle a few hundred primitives easily. If we encounter performance issues, an alternative is to do the generation on the server by running the OpenSCAD CLI or a Node library version of it. But ideally, keeping it in-browser is smoother for the user (no waiting on server jobs, no heavy load on our server).
To summarize, OpenJSCAD in the browser via React is our preferred solution for generating the 3D printable files. This approach has been demonstrated by others – for instance, a developer showed a React app that lets users customize a parts drawer and export the STL, noting that the OpenJSCAD approach was the most fruitful after experimenting with other methods ￼. We will follow a similar path for the crossover plate app.
Related Projects and Inspiration
Before building from scratch, it’s wise to see if any similar open-source projects exist and to draw inspiration from them. In the realm of speaker crossover mounting, there are a few related efforts:
	•	CSS Audio SmartNode Boards: While not open-source, this is a real-world commercial implementation of 3D-printed crossover boards. They confirmed the validity of the concept. We have cited their product to understand the features they included (like the labeling system) ￼. The takeaway is that simplifying the wiring and assembly process is a major selling point – our app should aim for that same benefit.
	•	DIY 3D-Printed Crossover Trays: Enthusiasts on forums have experimented with printing their own crossover holders. For example, a user “hxtasy” designed a 3D printed tray for the popular TriTrix speaker kit’s crossover and shared it on Thingiverse ￼. His design held the components in place and likely resembled a basic version of what we want to automate. Community feedback on that project suggested adding features like mounting feet and wiring holes to improve it ￼, which aligns with the features we’ve planned. The TriTrix tray example shows that even back in 2014, DIYers saw value in printable crossover boards – but each design was one-off. Our project attempts to generalize this so anyone can create a custom board for any crossover.
	•	DIY Layout Creator (DIYLC): Though this is a 2D electronics layout tool (not for 3D printing), it serves as inspiration for the user interface. DIYLC allows users to drag components onto a canvas to create layouts for perfboards, stripboards, or wiring diagrams. It includes a component library and shows components as scaled icons. This is very analogous to what we need on the front-end. DIYLC is open-source ￼ and demonstrates how a library of parts and an intuitive UI can greatly aid hobbyists in design. We can draw ideas for how to represent components visually and how to handle user interactions (e.g. rotating parts, aligning them, etc.). Our app will do something similar, then move into 3D generation as the final step. The key point from DIYLC is providing “an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for placing components... and visualizing designs before assembly” ￼, which we strive to emulate in a web context.
	•	OpenJSCAD and Parametric Model Tools: On the technical side, we looked at open-source efforts to integrate CAD into web apps. The openjscad-react library (MIT-licensed on GitHub) is a direct foundation we can use ￼ ￼. Additionally, projects like CadHub (a code-cad sharing platform) and other parametric model generators show that there is an active community in this space ￼. We also note that companies like Bambu Lab have explored bringing OpenSCAD capabilities to broader audiences (as seen in All3DP news) – this indicates parametric design is becoming more mainstream, so our timing is good ￼.
	•	Generic PCB or Crossover Boards: There are some existing products like generic crossover PCBs (e.g. perforated boards or PCBs with patterns for soldering crossover parts). However, those are not customizable to specific component sizes, whereas our solution is fully custom. We did not find an open-source tool that generates 3D printable boards specifically for crossovers, which means our project would fill a unique niche. We’ll borrow what we can from adjacent projects, but largely we’re breaking new ground tailored to the audio DIY community.
In summary, by examining these sources, we have affirmed the need for this application and gathered ideas on implementation. The open-source tools for CAD and layout will greatly assist us in development, while the examples of printed boards guide us on functional requirements.
Future Enhancements and Considerations
Once the basic application is up and running with the core functionality (select parts → arrange → export STL), there are several enhancements and refinements we can explore:
	•	Expanding the Parts Library: After the initial prototype, we’ll want to include a much broader range of components. This means collecting dimensions for various brands and models (e.g. more capacitor lines from Mundorf, ClarityCap, Solen; different coil sizes including iron-core inductors or cored inductors which might have different shapes; different resistor types, etc.). We might integrate an online database or provide an interface for users to request or add new parts. Verification will be important to maintain accuracy.
	•	Custom Part Entry: For absolute flexibility, allow the user to define a custom component by entering its shape and dimensions (e.g. “cylinder, 25 mm diameter, 60 mm long, leads at ends 60 mm apart”). The app could then treat that like any known part. This would handle cases where a user’s component isn’t in our library.
	•	Auto-Routing or Node Grouping: A stretch goal is to incorporate some electrical intelligence – for example, if a user labels the input, output, and nodes of the crossover, the app could auto-label the holes with letters or symbols to indicate which ones connect together (similar to CSS’s lettering system). We could even show a simplified schematic of the connections. This would move the tool closer to bridging the gap between circuit design and physical layout. Even without full autorouting, just having a way to mark that “these two holes are connected to Node A” and then having “A” printed on the board, would help the builder during wiring.
	•	Alternative Outputs: While STL for 3D printing is a focus, we could also generate 2D drill guides or laser-cut templates. For instance, some users might prefer to laser-cut a wooden board with holes drilled for leads (and use clamps for parts). Our parametric model could easily output a DXF of hole positions and outlines if needed. This would broaden the use beyond just 3D printing.
	•	Visualization and Verification: We could add features like checking that components don’t overlap or that a component fully fits on the board. The app could highlight if two recesses overlap erroneously (though if the user places them, it should be obvious visually). We might also let the user input the internal dimensions of their speaker cabinet section where the crossover will be mounted, to ensure the board will fit.
	•	User Accounts and Saving Designs: For a production deployment, allowing users to save their crossover plate designs (maybe even share them) would be useful. This ties into perhaps a small backend to store projects. It could evolve into a repository of crossover board designs for various popular speaker kits, contributed by the community.
	•	3D Printing Guidance: The app could offer tips once the STL is generated, such as recommended print settings. For instance: print with at least X% infill for strength, use ABS or PETG if high resistor wattage is present, or remind the user to orient the board flat on the print bed. Perhaps even suggest support material settings if there are overhangs (though our design of shallow recesses should be very printable without supports, since they are only a few mm deep – a gradual curved recess can be bridged easily by a printer).
	•	Integration with Crossover Design Software: In the long run, one could imagine integrating this with electrical design tools. For instance, a user designs a crossover filter in software (calculates component values), then uses our tool to lay out the actual parts. If both tools could communicate, it would streamline the whole speaker design process. Projects like VituixCAD or XSim produce a parts list – that list could potentially be imported into our app to auto-populate the components (future idea).
Throughout development, we will keep exploring open-source resources and communities (such as the DIY Audio forum, r/diyaudio on Reddit, etc.) for feedback. The best practice is to build on existing knowledge and tools ￼, and we are doing exactly that by utilizing frameworks like React for the interface, OpenJSCAD for CAD, and referencing successful examples for guidance.
In conclusion, this project brings together web development, CAD automation, and the DIY audio hobby. By researching existing tools and methods, we’ve formed a solid plan: a React-based web app powered by parametric CAD scripts, informed by real-world component data and prior art in both software and hardware. When completed, users will be able to select their crossover components, arrange them visually, and automatically get a 3D-printable plate design that elevates the quality and appearance of their DIY speakers. This will make the process of building crossovers more accessible and enjoyable, giving enthusiasts a level of customization and professionalism previously out of reach without custom engineering. The combination of a friendly drag-and-drop UI and powerful automated 3D modeling embodies the best practices of modern maker tools – and we’re excited to bring this idea to life.

	•	Fields (describe, don’t code): brand, model line, nominal value, body shape (cylinder/ring/rectangular), body dimensions (D × L or OD × ID × H), lead diameter, lead exit geometry (axial ends, tangential for coils), default recess depth (mm), default lead-hole diameter (mm), min clearances (mm), printable label text (e.g., “6.8 μF”).
	•	Seed initial parts (5–10 SKUs) from manufacturers/resellers that publish dimensions (e.g., Jantzen Alumen Z-Cap, Jantzen/Intertechnik air-core coils, Mundorf MResist Supreme, AUDYN Cap Plus). Cite the vendor docs you use for the seed set, keep unit consistency (mm).  ￼
Best-practice notes
	•	Prefer manufacturer/datasheet sizes; if using reseller pages, archive the value you used and include source URL in a comment field.
	•	Version your library records; stamp libraryVersion in layouts so future changes don’t break old designs.
Acceptance criteria
	•	JSON/records exist for the seed parts with verified real-world dimensions (spot-check 2–3 sources when possible).
	•	Validation rules documented (e.g., lead hole must be ≥ lead_dia + 0.4 mm).
⸻
Stage 3 — 2D Placement Canvas (2–3 days)
What to implement
	•	Top-down canvas to drag/drop parts from a toolbox onto a board; grid and snap (grid size configurable); rotate in 15° increments; nudge via keyboard; multi-select; align tools; undo/redo.
	•	Each part shows:
	•	Body footprint (e.g., cylinder projection).
	•	Lead exit points as visible markers.
	•	Local axes/origin indicator for orientation clarity.
	•	Board sizing modes:
	1.	Manual (user sets W×H×thickness).
	2.	Auto-fit with margin to bound placed parts.
	•	Collision & clearance checks: live warnings if body footprints overlap or if lead holes would fall outside the board or violate clearances.
	•	Labels (2D): toggle display of component value and ref-name; choose label side/top/bottom.
Why 2D first?
	•	Matches how DIYLC presents layouts (simple, intuitive part placement before fabrication).  ￼ ￼ ￼
Acceptance criteria
	•	Place, rotate, snap, and auto-fit work smoothly at 60 fps for at least 50 parts.
	•	Visual warnings appear for overlap/clearance errors.
	•	Board bounds and thickness configurable.
⸻
Stage 4 — Geometry Engine Abstractions (1 day)
What to implement
	•	A clean intermediate geometry spec (IGS) separate from UI state:
	•	Board: width, height, thickness, corner fillet (optional), mounting holes spec.
	•	For each part instance: type, world position (x,y), rotation, body dims, recess depth, computed lead hole coordinates, label text & placement.
	•	Deterministic ordering of boolean ops (base plate minus recesses minus holes plus embossed labels) to avoid non-manifold artifacts.
Acceptance criteria
	•	Transform math verified: rotating an axial part repositions lead holes correctly.
	•	Unit tests on geometry math pass for a few canonical placements.
⸻
Stage 5 — JSCAD Integration & 3D Preview (2 days)
What to implement
	•	OpenJSCAD in browser to generate solids from the IGS and preview. The model must support:
	•	Base plate extrusion.
	•	Boolean difference for recesses (cylindrical pockets, ring pockets).
	•	Through-holes for leads.
	•	Optional embossed/engraved text for labels (use simple fonts for printability). (OpenSCAD/JSCAD workflows commonly extrude text; keep height ~0.5–0.8 mm).  ￼ ￼
	•	Prefer openjscad-react / official JSCAD viewer to avoid writing a viewer from scratch.  ￼ ￼
	•	Performance budget: live preview must update within ~500 ms for small boards, ≤2 s for boards with ~50 parts.
Acceptance criteria
	•	Toggling a part’s rotation or moving its position updates the 3D preview deterministically.
	•	No non-manifold warnings in exported meshes (spot-validate with STL viewers).
⸻
Stage 6 — STL Export & Validation (0.5–1 day)
What to implement
	•	Client-side STL export via JSCAD; ensure millimeter units.  ￼ ￼
	•	Attach metadata (e.g., layout name, date, libraryVersion) in a sidecar JSON for the user’s records.
	•	Basic mesh validation: bounding box, triangle count, ensure through-holes fully penetrate thickness, recess depth ≤ plate thickness − safety_margin.
Acceptance criteria
	•	Downloaded STL loads cleanly in common slicers.
	•	Holes measure within ±0.1–0.2 mm of intended size (acknowledge printer calibration can change fit).
⸻
Stage 7 — Labeling & UX Details (1 day)
What to implement
	•	Label placement options: top emboss, top engrave, or underside engrave (for mirrored boards).
	•	Node marking (optional MVP+): allow user to assign a node letter to lead holes; render small embossed letters near holes (inspired by commercial crossover boards that letter hole connections). Keep simple for MVP. (This is analogous to CSS’s labeled holes simplifying assembly.)  ￼
Acceptance criteria
	•	Labels remain legible at chosen font size after extrusion (visual QA in preview).
	•	Node letters do not overlap holes or fall off the board edge.
⸻
Stage 8 — Accessories & Constraints (0.5–1 day)
What to implement
	•	Mounting features: optional corner holes; optional standoffs (parametric: height, diameter).
	•	Tie-down features for coils: optional zip-tie slots adjacent to ring recesses.
	•	Clearance rule set: minimum distances between holes, board edge, and features; UI warns when violated.
Acceptance criteria
	•	Turning on/off accessories updates geometry and preview predictably.
	•	No slot/feature intersects another feature or exits the board.
⸻
Stage 9 — Persistence, Import/Export, and Sharing (1 day)
What to implement
	•	Save/Load design objects (layout JSON + libraryVersion stamp).
	•	Shareable link (encode via shortlink backend or compressed state in URL for small layouts).
	•	Export “cut sheet” PDF (optional MVP+): top-down 2D with hole coordinates for drill reference.
Acceptance criteria
	•	Loading a saved design reproduces identical geometry (hash compare on IGS).
	•	Library version mismatch warning prompts the user to migrate or lock to old library.
⸻
Stage 10 — Testing Matrix & Quality Gates (ongoing, first pass 1 day)
Automated
	•	Unit tests for transforms (lead hole math, rotation).
	•	Property tests: random placements within board stay valid; holes remain within bounds.
	•	Snapshot tests on IGS → STL vertex/face counts stable for fixed seeds.
Manual
	•	Performance: 10, 25, 50 part layouts.
	•	Printability: verify STL orientations, wall thickness > nozzle × 2; recess curvature bridging OK.
	•	Accessibility: keyboard placement controls; high-contrast canvas.
Acceptance criteria
	•	All tests pass; documented print guidelines provided (material notes, e.g., PETG/ABS tolerances).
⸻
Stage 11 — Deployment Strategy (0.5 day)
MVP path (recommended):
	•	Vercel for static/Next.js app. Client-side JSCAD avoids heavy server compute; watch serverless function limits if you add any APIs (duration/file descriptors).  ￼
When to choose Railway
	•	If you add server-side CAD, large file processing, background scraping, or a database for community libraries → deploy a persistent Node service on Railway (easy GitHub deploy, env vars, DB add-ons).  ￼ ￼
Acceptance criteria
	•	One-click deploy documented for both targets; environment variables and build steps clarified.
⸻
Stage 12 — Roadmap (Post-MVP)
	1.	Bigger parts library with manufacturer-sourced dimensions; add a contribution workflow (moderated).
	2.	Custom part wizard (user enters D×L, lead geometry; app generates a one-off footprint).
	3.	3D preview upgrade (R3F for richer manipulation if needed; stick with JSCAD viewer otherwise).  ￼
	4.	Laser/DXF output for users who prefer laser-cut plates.
	5.	Basic node grouping and lettered hole logic to guide wiring (inspired by existing labeled crossover boards).  ￼
	6.	Mounting templates (cabinet fit checks) and parametric feet/spacers.
	7.	Optional server jobs (Railway) for heavy mesh ops or dimension-scrape pipelines (respect robots.txt & TOS).
⸻
Implementation Notes & Guardrails (for the AI coder)
	•	Geometry engine: keep UI state separate from manufacturing spec (IGS). Determinism matters: same input → same mesh.
	•	Boolean robustness: order ops consistently; clamp recess depth; keep hole cylinders taller than plate thickness to ensure clean through-cuts.
	•	Units: everything in mm; stamp units in metadata.
	•	Tolerance: default hole_dia = lead_dia + 0.4–0.6 mm; expose as global setting.
	•	Performance: batch updates to preview (debounce), or “Preview 3D” button for huge layouts.
	•	Font/labels: use simple vector fonts suitable for small emboss/engrave; avoid fancy fonts. (OpenSCAD/JSCAD workflows commonly linear-extrude text.)  ￼
	•	UX: grid + snap, keyboard shortcuts (R rotate, arrows nudge, ⌘Z undo), and live warnings reduce misprints.
	•	Inspiration: The ethos mirrors DIYLC’s drag-drop clarity—users plan physical layout visually, then fabricate.  ￼ ￼
⸻
Quick Decision Cheatsheet
	•	CAD engine → JSCAD in browser for modeling & STL export.  ￼
	•	React integration → Use openjscad-react or official JSCAD viewer.  ￼ ￼
	•	3D preview → Start with JSCAD’s built-in; consider R3F later for richer scenes.  ￼
	•	Hosting → Vercel for client-heavy MVP; Railway if/when you add long-running jobs.  ￼ ￼
